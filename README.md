# 1DL034_introduction_to_machine_earning_project
Worked on a machine learning group project at Uppsala University in the spring of 2021.

In the course of this work, we mastered and improved our skills of working with training
and test models, mastered the system of working with visual components and learned more about
machine learning models for supervised machine learning.

The dataset we worked on: https://www.kaggle.com/c/heart-disease-uci

Our group ranked 3rd among 25 groups, with only 4 entries (which is less than the first two ranking projects).
